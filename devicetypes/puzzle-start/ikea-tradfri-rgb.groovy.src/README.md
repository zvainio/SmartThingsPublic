IKEA Tr√•dfri RGB Bulb

Color management is not trivial. IKEA bulbs are using CIE XY color scheme instead of Hue/Saturation. Also the 
bulbs do not seem to be able to output "light cyan" color. Maybe it is my fault for not having being able to
identify the correct color scheme (currently assuming sRGB with gamma correction), but cannot either with the 
IKEA remote pairing...

This handler is written so that it reports any change in the bulb state (on/off, brightness, color) as an event 
immediately to be processed by other apps.

Version: 1.1

TO DO:
 * Color presets
 * Enable debug logging on app settings
 * Remove custom code when ST correctly parses both all color attributes and multiple reporting in one message
 * Color event should send string with hue and saturation values instead of hex, as per API reference, but when
   doing so, the color picker does not get updated
